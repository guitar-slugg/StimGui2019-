
StimGui READ ME:

Requires MATLAB >= 2015a
Designed for use with a TDT RZ6 processing unit. 

The overall goal of this code is to set up a workable and flexible GUI framework, 
that allows easy future changes/modifications. 

The Gui is launched by calling StimGui from the command line in MATLAB.

From there, you can run various procedures and collect data in a flexible way. 




The GUI consists of these parts:

StimGui.m:  This is the main class for the program, it handles tyeing together the various parts, 
and interacting with the user. 

StimGuiProcedures.m: This class contains a bunch of static methods for getting data. These are usually called from StimGui, 
but they don't have to be. Additional methods/procedures can be added by users as needed. 

StimGuiUserSettings.m: This class just holds fields for user settings. These settings are loaded by StimGui and usually passed
to a procedure in StimGuiProcedures.m. StimGui loads all saved user settings files in the UserSettings folder. So, if you would like to 
add or remove a settings file, that folder is the place to do it. 

TDTDrivers.m: This class contains wrappers for interacting with an active .rcx circuit, running on the TDT box. 
The methods contained in this class can be used to put together a procedure, like the ones found in StimGuiProcedures. 

rcxCircuit.rcx: This in a circuit built with TDT's Open_Ex software package. This circuit is translated into code that runs 
on the TDT box. All low level interaction with the TDT box ultimately depends on this circuit. All other code is basically 
just wrapping this code. 

filterA.m: a function to produce "A weighting" filter weights. 

Calibrations folder: This folder contains .mat files generated as calibrations.
